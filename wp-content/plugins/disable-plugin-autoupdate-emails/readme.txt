Getting too many "plugin updated" or "theme updated" emails since WordPress 5.5? This turns them off.

== Description ==

There's not much to this plugin. It's a couple barebones filters that turn off the plugin and theme autoupdate emails.

On WordPress 5.5.0, plugin/theme autoupdate emails are turned off regardless of whether or not they failed.

Since WordPress 5.5.1, emails indicating update failures are allowed through.

== Changelog ==

= 1.1 =
* Allow mixed/failure emails to get through (WordPress 5.5.1+)

= 1.0 =
* Initial release
